# Code Quiz - Javscript

In order to familiarize myself with dynamically adding elements to the web pages, I decided to create a quiz that is primarily built through Javascript.

- The "Start Quiz" button is clicked, the Quiz should initialize.
- The quiz initializes a 60 second timer
- Elements on the page are hidden and replaced with new elements
-  When the quiz is over, the user is able to submit their name and save their High Score.

## Lessons Learned

While attempting this project, my goal was to implement features such as saving to LocalStorage, time intervals, and dynamically update my webpage.
Through this project, I was also able to traverse the DOM with more ease and gained a deeper understanding of how to create, set variables, and append these elements by using Javascript.

## Optimizations // Known Issues

In it's current state, I was unable to implement some key-features such as:
-  End game screen with High Scores table
-  Quiz choices/buttons functionality
